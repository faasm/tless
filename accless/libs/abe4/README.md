# abe4

This directory contains the implementation of Accless' CP-ABE scheme. It is
based on the `opt4` shceme presented in [ABE-Cubed](
https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/1230), and we re-use a lot of the codebase
included in the [paper](https://github.com/lincolncryptools/ABE_Cubed). Credit
goes to the original authors, Sven Vath and Marloes Venema.
