# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Accless access control C++ library
#
# This library supports native compilation and cross-compilation to WebAssembly.
# Each version of the library has slightly different features:
# - Native:
#       - library to interact with S3 KV
#       - library to fetch a cVM's attestation from a vTPM on Azure
# - WASM:
